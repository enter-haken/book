# vim 

The heart of every developers toolchain is the editor.
You can choose, what ever you like. 
When you are developing a java or .net based system, you may be better of using a full blown IDE.
But this is not neccessary every time.
I want to show you, how far you can get, using `vim` as you primary editor.

You can find `vim`on almost every system out there.
Over the last decades a wide ecosystem has emerged.
You can extend `vim` with serveral [plugins](/environment/vim/bundles) to get a more IDE like editor.
