# Repository ownership

Weeks ago my colleagues and I had a discussion about code ownership. Over years ownership may skip over to other developers e.g. due to job change. For a approximation you can start with the files, checked in to repository. I will use the [Angular.js](https://github.com/angular/angular.git) repository for demonstrations.

<!--more-->

First make a local clone.

```
$ git clone https://github.com/angular/angular.git
```

A list of files can be obtained by

```
git ls-tree --full-tree -r HEAD
```

The first 10 entries look like 

```
100644 blob 9b2abeb660ab6c38a2378afd3a2f31bbca10cac3    .bowerrc
100644 blob 8d1c3c310286f5569e9ae2d99a5b50320a177e36    .clang-format
100644 blob f1cc3ad329c5d5be1f19d75f27352ea695de0afc    .editorconfig
100644 blob b7ca95b5b77a91a2e1b6eaf80c2a4a52a99ec378    .gitattributes
100644 blob 5f639fc3384e36b91c6efd28cf60e168680ce9f7    .github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE.md
100644 blob 8d93de2e45f1e6bf146cefd8b18526b2d99aaa82    .github/PULL_REQUEST_TEMPLATE.md
100644 blob 8060eef4d4c04f1f7f1aa6a48e9aaf7dc5e12584    .gitignore
100644 blob ade65226e0aa7e8abed00fc326362982f792b262    .nvmrc
100644 blob f31ef0d7d6996c8e202380b7a6bdfcb3ed757267    .travis.yml
100644 blob 0eefaa57ce1dfc216428f5664b632ec324cf918e    CHANGELOG.md
```

This command will give you all the files in the repository. (sub repositories are not considered at this point).

If you want to see, what is happening in a specific file the `git log` command is your friend. Let's look at an example.

```
$ git log --since="4 weeks ago" CHANGELOG.md
```

will give you an overview over the last four weeks for a specific file.

docs(changelog): update change log to beta 9

commit 2830df4190e98d05bad396993776d31ba6efa6e2

```

we will only need the committer names.

```
$ git log --format="%an"  --since="4 weeks ago" CHANGELOG.md
Jeremy Elbourn
Evan Martin
Vikram Subramanian
vsavkin
```

Now we take all committers, count their names and take the first in list.

```
$ git log --format="%an" CHANGELOG.md | sort | uniq -c | sort -rn | head -n 1
     10 Igor Minar
```

This statement is very simple. "Igor Minar made the most commits on the file CHANGELOG.md". There are several ways to get the name after the count. Here is one.

```
$ echo "     10 Igor Minar" | xargs -e | cut -d " " -f2-
Igor Minar
```

The `xargs -e` command eliminates the leading white spaces. Splitting after the first whitespace gets the name.

Now we are almost ready. Putting all the peaces together will lead us to.

```
#!/bin/bash
for file in ` git ls-tree --full-tree -r HEAD | awk '{ print $4}'`;
do
    git log --format="%an" $file | sort | uniq -c | sort -rn | head -n 1 | xargs -e | cut -d " " -f2-
done
```

This script prints for each file the name of the committer with the most commits. When you pipe the output of this script into `committers.log` you can get the "main committers" for the whole repository.

```
$ cat committers.log | sort | uniq -c | sort -rn | awk '$1 > 10 { print }'

The output gives you a hint, what is currently happening in the repository. 
It says nothing about the quality of the work of the committer. 
[Rewriting commits](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Git-Tools-Rewriting-History) is often use to have a slim commit history. 
Others leave the commits as they are. 
For an older repository it may be more interesting, what has happened e.g. in the last two years. 
With a few adjustments this can be achieved. 
See [git log --since](https://git-scm.com/docs/git-log) for more information.
