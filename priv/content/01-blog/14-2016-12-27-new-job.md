# six months in new job

This year is almost done. 
I got a new place for work and found a new old friend the [Deutsche Bahn][1].
My way to work consist now of cycling and going by train.

I've kept the ten kilometers cycling, but instead of urban canyons, I've got more nature.

It is ok for now. 
If you remove the December (German Christmas market time), I have approximately one our for one direction.

From a professional point of view it has become more quiet. 
I am currently working on a mature dot net stack. 
My work is planed and reviewed by several instances.
I am in a controlled environment and there are less surprises.

At this time, this is exactly what I need, but how looks the next step like? 

My batteries are full again, and I've got more effective time for my own.
My work life has become more predictable and stable. 
Time to build something cool ;)
