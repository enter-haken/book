```experience
January 2019 - til now
Lemonbeat GmbH

I am working on a `distributed IOT platform` in the residential real estate area, 
where data from devices, normaly found in basements like heating systems or water 
pumps can send data to the cloud.
```

```experience
September 2017 - December 2018
NWB Verlag GmbH

It was my responsibility to develop new products for the German tax industrie.
I created a `job platform` for tax specialist, with a simple matching algorithm.

July 2016 - August 2017
i-SOLUTIONS Health GmbH

The [i-SOLUTIONS Health GmbH](https://i-solutions.de/) creates hospital information 
systems for decades.

As hospitals write letters to resident doctors, I have created a solution to send 
encrypted and signed letters via [gematik](https://www.gematik.de/) network.

```experience
July 2012 - June 2016
protel hotelsoftware GmbH

During my time at [protel](https://www.protel.net), I built a `booking interface` for the [Best Western Hotels](https://www.bestwestern.com), where prices, 
availabilities, guests and reservations are syncronized between the Best Western systems 
and the protel systems.

As protel wanted to provide more guest information for their customers, I developed a 
`survey application`, which is deeply integrated into the protel core software. 

Protel provides a web booking engine for their customers. I created a `billing engine`, 
which is syncronized with the protel ERP system.

Protels software uses over 30000 labels over different applications. I developed a 
`localisation tool`, where every customer can define own translations.

```experience
October 2009 - June 2012 
GHX Europe GmbH

[The GHX Europe GmbH](https://www.ghx.com/) operates an order platform in the healthcare industry. 
It connects healhcare suppliers with hospitals and hospital groups.

As price negotiations can be very complex, I created a `price database` where these
price negotiations can be visualized. 

Some hospital groups buy products worth over one billion Euros a year. 
For this case, I created a `datawarehouse` with an `OLAP cube`.

Normally the ERP systems of healthcare suppliers and hospitals are deeply connected. 
But there are some suppliers, which are working with fax devices. 
I created a system, which can generate `customized fax documents` from xCBL (XML based) data,
and send them to the supplier.

```experience
July 2008 - June 2009
isc integrated software concepts AG

I created a configration tool for a `access controll system`, where user data like fingerprints are stored.
