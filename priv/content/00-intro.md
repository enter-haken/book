# introduction

My name is Jan Frderik Hake.
I am a software developer from Dortmund, Germany.
This is my view of how software development craftsmanship should be.

As this is a living document, it will grow and shrink with time. 

<!--
This is a quick overview, what is needed to develop a web application. 
-->


<!--
## develop

A lot of questions are out there, before you even write a single line of code. 

* How get your idea up and running?
* How do you store your data?
* Do you solve your problem bottom up or top down?
* Which clients are you argeting?
* Which architecture are you intend to use?
* Are there programms out there, which may help you designing your application?

At first you have to think about your problem, before start solving it. 
This is about [designing](/develop/design.html) an application.

The developing section is targeting a web based sollution (for now).

You can find information about [scripting](/develop/languages/scripting), backend languages like [erlang](/develop/languages/beam/erlang.html) or [elixir](/develop/languages/beam/elixir.html), 
and frontend targeting languages and frameworks like [typescript](/develop/languages/typescript.html), [angular](/develop/languages/angular.html) or [react](/develop/languages/react.html).
Most of them are a brief introduction into the topic with further linked content.
An other big part is the [testing area](/develop/testing), where you can find different testing techniques like [unit testing](/develop/testing/unit_testing.html) or [integration testing](/develop/testing/integration_testing.html).

## run 

When you are done with your work, and want to introduce your application to the world, you might have some questions about running your application.
Web applications usually are running on servers, connected to the internet. 
If you have a simple website (like this one) you can run your site manually. 
You have to ask yourself, if you like to run your application on [bare metal](/run/baremetal.html) or within a [cloud infrastructure](/run/cloud.html).
But if you have a more complex application you might need something like [infrastructure as code](/run/infrastructureascode.html).
