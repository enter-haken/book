# introduction

My name is Jan Frederik Hake.
I am a software developer from Paderborn / Germany.
This is my view of how software development craftsmanship should be.

As this is a living document, it will grow and shrink with time. 

# projects

Let's start with the result first. 
This is a list of software, which you can actually run either online, or on your machine. 

## retro

When the Covid19 pandemy started, we went to homeoffice. 
As I am working for a small company, there was no huge step to work from home. 
The vpn was in place before, and it has been working quite well.

When it comes to the scrum process, we tried different solutions for our retrospective. 
All of them required a kind of login and had a lot of feature, where we needed only a fraction of this. 
So I give it a try and try to [build something for my own][1].

It was quiet a lot of fun, and I have a new playground for `angular` and `elixir`.
There is no need for a personalized login.
Every retro session is only kept within memory.

## Memory UI

How are thoughts linked?

I first started with the [brain project][5]. 
I placed every memory within a markdown file.
Every file contains a header with metadata and some text.
Every memory can have a link to an other memory.
All memories and all links represents a knowlede graph, presented by an [adjacency list][6].
I collected some [memories][7] over time.

To get a first impression for usefullness, I created a [static client][8].

You can [play around][9] if you like.

## frank

I think, `github` is one of the best plattforms, created in the last decades.
It has brought more freedom and diversity to the software landscape out there. 

So what is frank?

![frank](/images/frank_start.png)

Frank is **no replacement** for `github` or `gitlab`. 
At the time of writing it is a frontend for [git grep][2]. 

I wanted to have a tool where you easily search repositories. 

You can take a look at my instance of [frank][3], or take a look at the [code][4].

This project is still in **alpha state**.

# the rest

If the projects are the result of my doing, the next parts shows the road to it.

<!--
## develop

A lot of questions are out there, before you even write a single line of code. 

* How get your idea up and running?
* How do you store your data?
* Do you solve your problem bottom up or top down?
* Which clients are you argeting?
* Which architecture are you intend to use?
* Are there programms out there, which may help you designing your application?

At first you have to think about your problem, before start solving it. 
This is about [designing](/develop/design.html) an application.

The developing section is targeting a web based sollution (for now).

You can find information about [scripting](/develop/languages/scripting), backend languages like [erlang](/develop/languages/beam/erlang.html) or [elixir](/develop/languages/beam/elixir.html), 
and frontend targeting languages and frameworks like [typescript](/develop/languages/typescript.html), [angular](/develop/languages/angular.html) or [react](/develop/languages/react.html).
Most of them are a brief introduction into the topic with further linked content.
An other big part is the [testing area](/develop/testing), where you can find different testing techniques like [unit testing](/develop/testing/unit_testing.html) or [integration testing](/develop/testing/integration_testing.html).

## run 

When you are done with your work, and want to introduce your application to the world, you might have some questions about running your application.
Web applications usually are running on servers, connected to the internet. 
If you have a simple website (like this one) you can run your site manually. 
You have to ask yourself, if you like to run your application on [bare metal](/run/baremetal.html) or within a [cloud infrastructure](/run/cloud.html).
But if you have a more complex application you might need something like [infrastructure as code](/run/infrastructureascode.html).
