# environment 

Before you start creating software, you need a solid working environment.

Nowadays many of the software out there is running on linux based systems.
Your software should be developed on the target plattform.
It is important, to get used to the system you are targeting over time.

Know your tools.
No matter if you yet programm for some time, or you have just started to programm, you need a running environment.
Depending on your projects you are working on, you have a more or less complex stack.

When you develop software, you want as less complexity as possible.
So if you are aware of your [working environment](/environment/intro.html), you can focus on your developing work.
