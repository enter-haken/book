# dotfiles 

After packages are installed you can configure a package on system level within the `/etc` folder.
Many packages provide a local profile, which can be configured on a user basis. 
These called [dotfiles](/environment/dotfiles) should be configured in one place.
This is [how we do it](/environment/dotfiles/script.html).
